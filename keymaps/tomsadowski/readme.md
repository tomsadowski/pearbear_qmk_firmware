There are 3 layers: Alpha Layer, Mouse Layer, and Number Layer. From any of those layers, the other two layers can be momentarily accessed by holding either of the space buttons. The visuals below should clarify this.

Note: Since holding down the left-click button is a common use case, you must first access the Alpha Layer with the left thumb before accessing the Number Layer with the right thumb.

## Combos  

The caps-lock combo only turns caps-lock on. Caps-lock is turned off when a modifier or mode-switching combo is pressed.
